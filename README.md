# LED-lampa_arduino

One of my early Arduino-projects for a lamp with one RGB LED strip and one white LED strip. 
The code is commented in Swedish. 

The code is designed around the minimal hardware-interface of one button and one potentiometer. 
The lamp features two modes: a favorites mode with 13 presets (startup mode) and a color-blending mode accecible with a long-press on the button.
